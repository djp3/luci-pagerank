This is a java implementation of Page-Rank.

It consists of code that can be incorporated into your code to calculate Page-Rank as a function within your project.

It also has a user-interface if you have a graph that you would like to calculate the Page-Rank of through a gui.

Goals:
  * Support calculation of Page-Rank on graphs of 10,000,000 nodes or less with sparse weighted directional edges.

Use Cases:
  1. I have a graph that is described in a text file and I want to calculate the Page-Rank of it's nodes.
  1. I want to calculate Page-Rank of a graph-based data structure in my code and also use the results in my code.

Unsupported Use Cases:

  1. I want to learn how to dance like Beyonc√©
